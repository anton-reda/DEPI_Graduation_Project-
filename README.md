## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Retail businesses often rely on manual forecasting or outdated tools, leading to:

- ❌ Stockouts  
- ❌ Overstocking  
- ❌ Poor forecasting accuracy  
- ❌ No visibility into the impact of seasonality and external factors  
- ❌ Scattered data and inconsistent decision-making  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A data-driven forecasting approach built around a **XGBoost regression model** that predicts future sales based on historical patterns, seasonality, store characteristics, and external factors.  
The model’s predictions are then used in decision-making.
### ✔️ Key Benefits
